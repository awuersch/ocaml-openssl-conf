(* Intro

   Welcome to the implementation of Sslconf!

   0. Origin

   Sslconf recodes Openssl's NCONF "new config" parser in OCaml.
   The recoding should be conforming but simpler, cleaner, and unit tested.

   Openssl code is at https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ .
   The NCONF parser header is in "include/openssl" at "conf.h".
   NCONF parser code is in "crypto/conf" at

   - "conf_def.c"
   - "conf_api.c", and
   - "conf_lib.c".

   1. Line handling

   This describes [continued_line], [getline], [Buf.grow], and [Bio.gets].

   NCONF opens, reads, and parses a text file.

   Lines in the text file are terminated by newlines, either

   - Unix-style line feeds (LF), or
   - Windows style carrage return line feeds (CRLF).

   A text file read scans for a newline.
   The scan is limited up to a maximum block size (512 bytes).
   Maximum block size is 512 bytes.

   Reads go in a buffer.
   The maximum size of the buffer is bounded by a bit size length.
   Default bit size length is 31 bits.
   Unit tests can reduce buffer bit size length in order to trigger errors.

   The buffer is resized:

   - if a line is longer than the maximum block size; or
   - if the character immediately before the newline is a continuation
     character ['\\'], and the continuation character is not immediately
     preceded by another continuation character ['\\'].

   A line, for NCONF, is the sequence of lines, each separated by a
   continuation character.

   The newline at the end of a line is stripped out.
   Each newline preceded by a continuation characters is also stripped out,
   and its continuation character is stripped out too.

   If a line ends at the end of a file and no newline is present, then
   nothing is stripped out, unless a continuation character is present,
   in which case it alone is stripped out.

   For error reporting, this implementation saves the offsets of
   continued lines in the structure of a line.  Using these offsets,
   when an error happens, error reporting reports:

   - the line number of the error in the text file, and
   - the position of the error relative to the line in the text file.

   The structure of a line is defined in [continued_line].

   Two error types are defined relative to line handling:

   - "Open": if the text file cannot be opened.
   - "Extend": if the buffer cannot be resized.

   2. Line parsing.

   Parsing [Sslconf.parse_line] returns two hash tables:

   - a hash table mapping section names to stacks of name-value pairs; and
   - a hash table mapping "<section>::<name>" keys to values.

   If parsing fails, an error is returned.
   Returns and errors use OCaml's result structure.

   2.1. Lines to the Parser

   The parser recognizes three kinds of lines:

   - an empty, blank or commented out line.
   - a line declaring a new section.
   - a line assigning a value to a name.

   See interface documentation for more detail on line types.
   Comments here are relevant to the implementation.

   2.1.1. Section lines.

   [parse_line] recognizes the beginning of a section line.
   It delegates section parsing to

   - a scanner loop using [span_with_escapes], and
   - a value evaluator [parse_value].

   Then it recognizes end of section.

   2.1.2. Name/Value Assignments.

   At the most general level, an NCONF name-value assignment
   is made up of:

   - a name, followed by
   - an equal sign (['=']), followed by
   - a value.

   If the equal sign is not present, and the line is not one
   of the other two types, the parser will quit in error, and
   will report that no equal sign was found.

   [parse_line] does this general work.

   - It delegates name recognition to [parse_name].
   - It recognizes the equal sign.
   - It delegates value reading and evaluation to [parse_value].
   - Then it returns a result.

   2.1.2.1. Names.

   A qualified name is made up of:

   - a section, followed by
   - two colon characters, i.e., ["::"], followed by
   - a name.

   If only one colon character is seen, the parser will quit
   with an error, that two colon characters were not seen.

   A name, and the section of a qualified name, share the same
   syntax rules. These rules are the same as the section in a
   section line, with two changes:

   - unescaped white space in a name is not allowed.
   - the resulting name is NOT further processed, so escape
     characters remain in the name.

   White space before and after a name, up to the equal sign,
   is ignored (dropped).

   2.1.2.2. Values.

   The parser quits with an error if an empty value is seen.
   This can occur if only white space follows the equal sign,
   or if only white space after the equal sign is ended by a
   hash character (comment to end of line).

   A small set of characters introduce or delimit special processing.

   - a dollar sign (['$'])
     with optional wrap characters (["()"] or ["{}"])
     introduces name substitution.
   - quotes (['\''] or ['"']) suppress processing in wrapped subparts.
   - an escape character (['\\']) admits the next character unconditionally,
     and suppresses processing from it.

   In the case of name substitution, a special subclass is
   names with section "ENV".  These substitute from the process
   environment.

   The parser strips out special characters from value results,
   unless their special meaning was cancelled.

   [parse_value] recognizes values in name-value assignments.
   It recognizes special characters and delegates their processing.

   - name substitution is handled by [subst].
   - Unix and Cygwin quote processing is handled by [parse_quote].
   - Win32 double quote processing is handled by [parse_dquote].
   - escape char processing is handled directly by [parse_value].

   Section line sections apply [parse_value] escape char processing.

   2.1.2.2.1. Name Substitution.

   [subst] handles name substitution.

   Name substitution replaces names with values. Names used must have
   previously assigned values, or they must have section ["ENV"], and
   their name must exist in the process environment.

   If a start wrap character (['('] or ['{']) immediately follows the
   dollar sign, then the name to substitute must be immediately followed
   by the end wrap character ([')'] or ['}'], or the parser will fail
   and report an error that no end wrap character was seen.

   Names which fail to have a previously assigned value, or which are
   qualified names with section ["ENV"], whose name is not in the process
   environment, will cause the parser to fail with an error that a name
   could not be resolved.

   Parsing of a name used in name substitution is like that of a name
   used in name-value assignments, but with one further restriction:

   - punctuation is not allowed.

   A name used in name substitution may have only

   - alphanumeric characters,
   - underscores, or
   - two-character escaped sequences.

   2.1.2.2.2. Quote Wrapping in Unix and Cygwin.

   [parse_quote] handles quote wrapped strings in Unix and Cygwin.

   A single quote string is ended when a single quote is found, unless the
   single quote is preceded by an escape character (['\\']).

   Escape chars allow the next char to always be in the substring.

   The parser strips out escape characters from the substring it adds to
   the value, unless the escape character is itself escaped.

   The parser strips out wrapping single quotes.

   2.1.2.2.3. Quote Wrapping in Win32 (double-quotes only).

   [parse_dquote] handles double quote wrapped strings in Windows.

   A double quote string is ended when a double quote is found, unless the
   double quote is immediately preceded by a double quote.

   If two double quotes appear in the string, the parser replaces them with
   one double quote in the substring it adds to the value.

   Escape characters have no interpretation in double-quote strings.  They
   appear as themselves, unmodified.

   The parser strips out wrapping double quotes.

   3. Implementation Notes.

   3.1. The Astring Package.

   This implementation primarily uses Daniel Buenzli's Astring package.
   Astring defines a substring structure over base strings.  A substring
   structure is an interval range (a start position and an end position)
   in a base string. Substring representation minimizes string copies
   and replaces them, wherever possible, with substring creations and
   modifications.

   Strings can be converted to substrings, and substrings back to strings. 
   Scanners can traverse substrings and apply character predicates, returning
   matched and unmatched ("remainder") sections. Head characters and tail
   substrings can be taken from substrings. Substring lists can be concatenated
   to create new substrings. The interval range of a substring can be altered
   ("extended") without creating a new base string.

   3.2. OUnit2, Bisect, and Sexplib Packages.

   For unit testing, we use OUnit2, Bisect, and Sexplib.

   Bisect assures us that unit tests have test coverage.

   Sexplib allows canonical and comparable strings to be generated
   from results. We may change the choice of Sexplib here, to use
   an XML generator and comparator. If so, it should be easier to
   convert results to web representations for display.

   A testcase array ("test/testcase.ml") drives unit testing.
   It defines expected results as an option structure, so None
   is an option that returns success.

   Unit testing rewrites the testcase array to a side output file
   ("test/data/cases.out"). This file has all cases and their results,
   by writing out expected results as a Some value.  If all tests
   succeed, one can replace the testcase array with the side output
   file.

(** [getline ic] converts reads into a line for the parser.
  A result structure is returned.  If ok, an {!line} is returned.
  If error, the following is returned:
   * a message string;
   * the [nbits] of the buffer;
   * the length requested for a next read; and
   * the buffer memory max size limit.

  If an error is returned, it should be the error result of a call
  to extend the buffer. The memory allocation request would be 4/3
  times the requested length.

  [getline] handles:
   * I/O getting,
   * buffering,
   * buffer extending, and
   * continuation character handling.

  Returns a continued line and a list of offsets.
  The list shows where (at which offsets) next lines were appended.

  Logic here follows openssl code, except see note in code.

  Detail:

  A line for the parser can hold multiple lines from the channel.

  One hopes a piece (a block or a subblock) is a line from a channel.
  Almost always, it will be -- but it could be less.
  "Pieces" are assembled by char reads, until
   * a newline is found;
   * EOF is detected; or
   * a max length is read.

  Characters read are put in a buffer.
  The buffer is pre-extended so it can always hold a next piece.
  Buffer memory allocation is bounded by a max {!nbits} bit length.

  A piece may end with a line continuation.  A {e line continuation}
  is an escape character at the end of a piece (or just before,
  if the end is a newline). The special meaning of this character is
  nullified if an escape char is found just before it.

  {v This is \
a line with \
two line continuations. v}

   {v This is \
a line with two line continuations,\
ending with an escape char. \\ v}

  Ends of pieces, i.e., line continuations and newlines, are stripped.

  {v This was a line with two line continuations. v}

  {v This was a line with two line continuations, ending with an escape char. \\ v}

  The buffer concatenates
   * a first piece read;}
   * further pieces, if line continuations were found; and}
   * further pieces, if a piece is max length and has no newline.}}
  Relative offsets of pieces which follow any newlines read
  are saved as a list of integers.  This list is used by the parser for
  line and column number error reporting.

   [parse_line hts ht section line] parses a line.
   [section] is a default section.
   A result structure is returned.
   Ok returns a state to pass to the next [parse_line] call:
   {ul {- a default section;}
       {- a {!section_hashtbl}; and}
       {- a {!section_name_hashtbl}.}}
   Error returns:
   {ul {- a position offset in the string;}
       {- a procedure name; and}
       {- an error message.}}
   The position offset and procedure name show where an error was found.
