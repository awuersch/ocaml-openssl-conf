(*
   [gets ic buf pos_offset max] gets a line from an input channel [ic].

   chars are read from [ic].
   if a newline (['\n']) is found, the line ends.
   else, if [max] chars are read, the line ends.

   data goes into buffer [buf], starting at offset [pos].

   if less than [max] is returned, and no newline is at the end,
   then end of file was reached.
